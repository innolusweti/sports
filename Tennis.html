    <p>Tennis is a popular sport played worldwide, both recreationally and professionally. It is typically played between two players (singles) or two teams of two players each (doubles).</p>
    <p>The game is played on a rectangular court, divided by a net, with each side having a baseline and service boxes. The objective is to score points by hitting the ball over the net into the opponent's side of the court.</p>
    <p>Tennis is unique in its scoring system, with points counted as 15, 30, 40, and game, with players needing to win by two clear points. Games are played in sets, and matches can be determined by the best of three or five sets, depending on the competition.</p>

    <p>The sport is characterized by its intense physical activity, requiring endurance, agility, and strategic shot placement. Players must use a racket to hit a felt-covered rubber ball, which can be played on various surfaces such as grass, clay, or hard courts.</p>
