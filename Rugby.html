        <p>Rugby is a dynamic and physical sport enjoyed by millions worldwide. It combines elements of strength, strategy, and teamwork.</p>
        <p>It is an evasion, flow sport that requires skills of both physical and mental prowess.</p>
        <p>The game is played with an oval-shaped ball that can be kicked, carried, and passed from hand to hand. Unlike in football, the use of hands is a fundamental part of the game.</p>

        <h2>Types of Rugby</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Rugby Union:</strong> This version of the game involves 15 players on each team. It is characterized by a set of scrums, lineouts, and a more open game with more emphasis on kicking, tackling, and passing.</li>

        <h2>History of Rugby</h2>
        <p>Rugby was created in England in the early 19th century. Legend has it that during a football game at Rugby School in 1823, a player named William Webb Ellis picked up the ball and ran with it, thereby creating the distinct characteristics of rugby football. Over time, rugby evolved into two main forms, Rugby Union and Rugby League, both of which have grown into major international sports.</p>
